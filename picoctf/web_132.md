## Steps

- As soon as I open the site, i activate the inspector
- Configure to **Persist Log**
- Click in both button and compare the source code, network request and console.
- Then i see the diference where the method in each color
- I tried some things (dont remember what)
- I got the first clue (Maybe you have more than 2 choices)
- Then i tried to make the request in diferents ways, I tried changing to (PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
    - Changing the source code method and click the button
    - Creating a new DOM
    - Change the request in Network
- Nothing work, then used Curl to make the request, didnt work 
- Then I read the CTF again and then i saw de a**HEAD**
- I tryed the request method HEAD and it show the responde in Response Headers.

## Opinion

I already used POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS but no other. So this CTF can make the person learn about using de inspector and learn about different methods.

`GET - The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.`  
`HEAD - The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.`
